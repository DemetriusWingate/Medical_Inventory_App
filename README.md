# Medical_Inventory_App
This is a Medical Inventory app that allows user to add delete and update inventory database.
I've created a list that populates curent inventory which has a location and type associated with equpiment.
I have error checks in place that will look for invalid inputs.
Last but not least I have annotated the SOLID principles used to structure this app.
Planning on implementing some regex in the future.
